Modern advances in dental science now allow us to offer patients multiple options to help you enjoy a functional, secure, confident and beautiful smile -- all in our office. One of the many safe, successful and proven procedures is dental implants. It involves the installation of permanent replacement teeth supported by artificial dental root forms called dental implants. These tooth replacements look, feel and function like natural teeth. Dental implants have solved many problems associated with tooth loss that previously required replacement by removable full or partial dentures.
</p>
<p>
The procedure, referred to as osseo or biointegration, provides patients with the comfort and assurance of permanent teeth. Many patients find that dental implants restore their self-confidence and self-esteem and improve their quality of life.
</p>
<p>
Dental implants are designed to provide a foundation for replacement teeth that look, feel, and function like natural teeth. After the procedure the patient regains the ability to eat virtually anything and can smile with confidence, knowing that teeth appear natural and that facial contours will be preserved. The implants themselves are titanium posts that are placed into the jawbone where teeth are missing. The bone bonds with the titanium or bioceramic surface coating on top of the titanium alloy, creating a strong foundation for artificial teeth. In addition, implants can help preserve facial structure, preventing the bone deterioration which occurs when teeth are missing.

<p>
Dental implants are a great way to replace missing teeth. Implants also provide excellent support and stability for removable partial or complete dentures when dental appliances are required.
