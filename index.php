      <h3>Dental Implants</h3>
      <p>When one loses a tooth to decay, damage, or age, that smile is compromised. We hope to restore it in a way that maintains the smile’s natural integrity. With dental implants, replacement teeth become as secure as your natural teeth. Implants are the most biologically and aesthetically ideal tooth replacement option.<a href="implant.php">More info…</a> </p>
      <h3>Braces</h3>
      <p>For most people, a beautiful smile is the most obvious benefit of orthodontics. After your braces come off, you'll feel more self-confident. During your treatment, we want you to feel as comfortable as possible.<a href ="braces.php" >More info…</a></p>

      <h3>Teeth Whitening</h3>
      <p> Coffee, cigarettes, tea, aging, and even certain medications can discolor your teeth to such an extent that you may not want to smile. Zoom laser whitening is a popular procedure, and so is at-home tooth bleaching. We are happy to discuss the teeth bleaching method that might work best for you.
